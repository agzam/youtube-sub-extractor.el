00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.290
Every once in a while there comes a time when
Mike wakes up and he wants to make a change

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.090
in his life.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.820
Sometimes he wants to start exercising and
get into shape, other times he wants to read

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.500
more books, or start a meditation practice.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.359
So he decides that he's going to make this
his new habit.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.480
The first few days go very well, as Mike feels
motivated and excited about it.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.980
But as more days pass, his so called "new
habit", doesn't excite him anymore.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.230
So Mike says to himself, "It's fine, I'll
do it tomorrow."

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.690
Then tomorrow rolls around and he still doesn't
feel like doing it.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.450
Again he says; "Tomorrow."

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.210
This keeps on happening until his desired
new habit is nearly forgotten.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.699
However Mike isn't alone in his struggles,
as we've all been there at one point in time.

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.710
But why does this happen?

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.740
Why is it so hard to follow up on our new
habits?

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.560
Well, one of the reasons is that the habit
we're trying to form can seem a little overwhelming,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.240
so we have this mental resistance.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.780
In the beginning, when we're super motivated
it's much easier to do something.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.659
For example; going to the gym for 1 hour doesn't
seem that hard, because the initial motivation

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.390
is a powerful driving force.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.009
But when we're motivated it's also easy to
impose some super high expectations on ourselves.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.049
We think; "Ok, so I went to the gym for 1
hour the first few days.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.760
From now on I'll to go to the gym for 1 full
hour every single day."

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.439
But once that initial motivation fades away
after a few days, there is now nothing that's

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.369
driving us forward, and we haven't really
formed a habit yet.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.140
That's why when we're unmotivated, we'll probably
just skip gym altogether, as dedicating a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.100
whole hour to it seems daunting.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.590
So instead of relying on motivation to push
us forward, we should focus on making our

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.440
new habit, an actual habit.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.840
Let me explain what I mean, by introducing
you to the 2 minute rule.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.890
When the expectation is to read the whole
book, meditate for 1 hour or run 10 miles,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.340
your habit can be quite hard to start.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.850
Most of the tasks that you procrastinate on
aren’t actually difficult to do.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.870
You just avoid starting them because you make
them seem so.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.090
The idea of the 2 minute rule is to trick
your brain into thinking that the habit you're

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.180
about to do isn't hard.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.790
So what you want to do is break that big habit
down into a small 2 minute version of it.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.849
Your goals obviously can't be completed in
2 minutes, but every habit can be started

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.629
in that time.

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:02.290
And once you start doing something, it’s
much easier to continue with it.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.500
For example:

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.209
Want to make reading your new habit?

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.200
Use the 2 minute rule and read just one page
of a book.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.970
Just one.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.230
After that you can stop reading, but you have
to do it for a minimum of 2 minutes.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.750
The end goal might be to read the whole book,
but the expectation should be to just start

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.940
reading, no matter how little.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.840
People often think that reading one page is
pointless.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.620
But a new habit should not feel like a chore,
or you'll start to despise it.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.690
The actions that follow can be challenging,
but the first two minutes should be easy.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.690
The point of any habit is to make it a habit
in the first place.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.720
You're not expected to do it to a maximum
degree until you collapse of exhaustion.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.840
So first you need to train yourself to just
start, by taking the most simple baby steps.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.409
Once you start, it's so much easier to just
continue, because that mental resistance is

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.489
now gone and you're already doing the habit
you wanted to.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.400
Using the 2 minute rule, your goals should
change to something like this:

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.049
"Become a writer", becomes "Write just one
sentence."

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.630
"Floss all my teeth " becomes "Floss one tooth."

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.690
"Run three miles" becomes "Put on my running
shoes and go outside."

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.520
All of these things are easy to do, however
they are super important, as they are what

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.960
get you started.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.340
You can't write a book if you can't even write
a single sentence.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.090
Neither can you be an athlete if you can't
put on your running shoes.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.470
But even if it's just one word, or just a
walk around the block, it's more than nothing.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.620
And more importantly what you're doing is
you're forming and reinforcing the habit.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.000
Eventually that one sentence you wrote, turns
into a paragraph, which forms a chapter, which

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.830
in the end becomes a book.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.690
But you have to start with that first sentence.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.630
Let me give you an example of how I used the
2 minute rule in my own life.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.070
I've always wanted to play the piano, so I
bought myself one.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.830
For the first week I was excited and motivated
to play, so practicing wasn't a problem.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.240
But when that beginner's motivation faded,
I started playing less and less.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.070
However I took notice of this, so I set myself
a goal to practice every day for 1 hour.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.760
Again for the first few days it sparked some
new enthusiasm and I started playing again.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.560
But just like before, the motivation eventually
waned and the piano started gathering dust.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.360
Even if I wanted to play, my brain really
disliked the thought of doing 1 hour of grueling

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.360
practice.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.000
So it become much easier to just avoid it
altogether.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.630
This is when I realized that my high expectations
are preventing me from even starting.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.419
I thought that whenever I played the piano
I had to practice for at least one hour.

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.590
But because of that mentality I wasn't practicing
at all.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.310
However after applying the 2 minute rule,
my goal changed dramatically.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:29.860
I changed my objective into a new one:
Play anything on the piano for just 2 minutes.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.860
That's it.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.111
There was almost no mental resistance since
playing anything, no matter how badly, for

00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:38.350
just 2 minutes is a piece of cake.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.210
And my brain also liked the idea of doing
something so simple.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.030
But the real magic was that it was much easier
to continue practicing for longer after that.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.919
I mean, I was already sitting there and playing.

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.440
So why not just keep on going?

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.240
So I did.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.520
The 2 minute rule allowed me to make playing
the piano a habit and I actually haven't broken

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.220
the streak since that day.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.750
Every once in a while there comes a day when
I don't feel like playing after those 2 minutes

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.870
are up.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.069
And that's fine.

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:16.759
What's more important is that I reinforce
my habit consistently.

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:20.920
Even if I only play for 2 minutes, I've still
done more than someone who decides to not

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.250
touch their keyboard at all.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:29.509
Ultimately, I can't be a pianist if I can't
even play for 2 minutes.

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:33.759
So I encourage you to employ the 2 minute
rule yourself, whenever you are struggling

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:36.210
to stick with a habit.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.440
The most important part of any new habit is
just getting started.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.710
It’s not about how well or for how long
you you do it, it’s about consistently taking

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.010
action towards it.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:54.700
Instead of trying to create a perfect habit
from the start, do the easier thing on a consistent basis.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.770
That's how you'll make your habit, an actual
habit.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.790
Writing one sentence is better than not writing
anything.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.900
One minute of piano practice is better than
none at all.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.790
And one minute of reading is better than never
picking up the book.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:15.940
It’s far better to do less than you hoped
for, than to do nothing at all.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.539
There will be plenty of time to improve your
performance later on.

00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:24.870
Remember, you can't improve a habit that doesn't
exist.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.340
Just start and the rest will follow.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.759
