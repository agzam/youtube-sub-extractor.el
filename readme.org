#+title: youtube-sub-extractor.el

** Description
Extracts video subtitles using [[https://github.com/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]] (recommended) or ~youtube-dl~ and shows them in a buffer.

I was having a conversation one day and I couldn't recall the name of a term, something I learned from a YouTube video. That bothered me. After the chat, I went back to YouTube, found the video, and started searching through it. I increased the playback speed and went back and forth but still couldn't find it. After a few minutes of that struggle, I thought: "what the heck am I doing?". Then I wrote a tiny elisp function to extract subtitles. While reading through the subs I realized how much good stuff went past my ears (while watching the video).

** Prerequisites
It works by calling ~yt-dlp~ (preferred), or  ~youtube-dl~ command line utility. Make sure at least one of them is installed and available at ~$PATH~.

*** Why ~yt-dlp~ is a preferred option?
~yt-dlp~ is a ~youtube-dl~ fork that adds new features and fixes known bugs. Notably, it knows how to extract auto-generated subtitles, and ~youtube-dl~ does not (there's an outstanding bug that needs [[https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/29623][fixing]] - /as of October 2022/).

Without the option of extracting auto-generated subtitles, this package would be useless for the majority of videos on YouTube.

*Update*: Initially, it was written with the support of ~youtube-dl~, but lately, I've been using it exclusively with ~yt-dlp~. There are minor differences between these two tools, and the proper work with ~youtube-dl~ at this point is not guaranteed.

** Installation
The package is not published on MELPA (just yet). You can install it using your favorite Emacs package management tool.
